# HorizonEssentialsA
The Horizon Essentials Game Framework, Making you feel nostalgic since 2025! This is the A Variant, 
meaning it is just the essentials needed for generic stuff. No CMRF code here!

# What is this?
This little project of mine is essentially the framework I originally made for CMRF v3, now open source!
It is bugtested and semi produced by ai with refinements from me. The A Variant is the Web panel, the Loader, and the HE:Adonis Plugins to make it work with my API.
The loader is index.js, the Web Panel is index.html, and the plugin for adonis is WebPanelListener.lua, ensure these are used in conjuction and not individually.

# AI you say? How dare you!
I swear to god if any of you say that, you can kiss the open source goodbye. 
I put my soul into this, and I used ai to bug test and help me with some stuff. 
After all I am using this as a learning opportunity. It's not like I asked ai to generate the whole thing.(A long time ago it was generated by AI, however i eventually refined it into this.)

# How do I use this?
Glad you asked! Just read whats in the scripts! There's comments I got ai to write so I wouldn't have to.
Just follow it's instructions.
